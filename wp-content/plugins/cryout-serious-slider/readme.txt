Serious Slider uses the very familiar WordPress dashboard interface for creating slides and sliders so there's absolutely no learning curve. You just select the media image and press "Create Slider". After that it's like adding or editing WordPress posts, using featured images and other meta information like buttons and URLs.

Serious Slider works with all WordPress themes and has been designed to integrate seamlessly with our own [selected themes](https://wordpress.org/themes/author/cryout-creations/ "Cryout Creations Wordpress Themes").
